In this project, I worked with two sets of data: one containing household income records and another with household income statistics. The project involved the following steps:

1 - Data Cleaning:
Performed data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency in both datasets.
Addressed missing values, standardized formats, and removed duplicates to prepare the data for analysis.

2 - Exploratory Analysis:
Utilized Common Table Expressions (CTEs), GROUP BY, and JOIN operations to conduct exploratory analysis and uncover insights.
Through these techniques, I identified trends, such as income distributions across regions, average household incomes and medians, and comparative statistics between households based on demographic factors.

3 - Findings and Limitations:
Noted several interesting patterns, including areas with the highest mean and median income.
Identified limitations, such as the absence of collection dates and unclear time periods represented by the data.

Tools Used: MySQL (CTEs, GROUP BY, JOIN)
